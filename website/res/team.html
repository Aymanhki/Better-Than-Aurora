		Creating this project taught me how important teamwork is and how much we can help one another. It was my first-time 
		using Git as well and it has taught me to appreciate its usages: being able to merge new things in quickly, doing the comparisons 
		for us, showing conflicts with the appropriate information allowing us to select the correct one, and even more little things just to make 
		things simple. I learned how to use Android Studio and how creating a project is quite a task, it has increased my appreciation 
		for the apps we have today. Keeping the apps functionality and maintainability is quite difficult and something we take for granted 
		in our apps we use.

		Throughout the project, I have learned the importance of designing software structure prior to development. For example, towards 
		the end of iteration 3 adding one field to the database resulted in a massive overhaul for some constructors and thereby their usages. 
		I have also learned how to implement dynamic GUIs for portrait and landscape variation. But most importantly, I have learned how 
		cooperation between team members can relieve a lot of the pressure coming from a looming deadline. Overall, I strongly feel the skills 
		I gained in this course will be quite essential for my future career.

		My experience with this project has taught me how to better work with a group of people, and that communicating with everyone 
		is important for the projects progression. I learned how to design a static HTML site and learned how HTML files are 
		written and formatted. To accompay the HTML, I also learned how to use CSS to format the site and its contents to be more 
		presentable. I also learned how to format markdown files in Git Lab from this experience.

		As the development of the application progressed, I have learned that commenting, writing clutter-free code by keeping it short 
		and to the point are all very crucial in larger projects because of how vastly it increases maintainability and makes it a lot easier 
		for anyone else to work with and build on further. Working on this application has also taught me how to work as a part of a team, how 
		to make sure that we all communicate effectively during class time and outside of class time, when to hold weekly meetings to be able 
		to monitor progress and improve on it. Lastly, working on developing this application with a team has taught me how to use some of the 
		features of Git and how powerful Git can be in ensuring that our development team can work on making the next release an absolute and 
		fully-functioning improvement over the last.

		Throughout working on this project, I learned how to better work in a team. I gained more experience using git, writing tests, 
		and using Android Studio. Overall, I think I have started to think more about the code that I write. I have learned to take SOLID 
		principles into account, and now think more about how maintainable what Iâ€™m working on will be.
