		What went right in the development process?

		<div class="body">
		During the development process one of the things that worked in our favour was communication. 
		We were able to effectively communicate our ideas, which allowed us to create BTA and the design for BTA quickly. 
		We were also able to figure out what each of our roles in the group were, making the division of tasks easy. 
		We were able to use everyones time and skills well. By dividing up tasks we could also have each member be specialized 
		in a certain area of development.

		What went wrong in the development process?
		</div>
		<div class="body">
		Looking back at it now, Version Control must’ve been the most problematic aspect of the development process. Every iteration, 
		one or more of us would experience loss of relatively big chunks of code due to the way some merge conflicts were handled locally. 
		This was frustrating sometimes, and it caused a lot of unnecessary delays, ironically close to release dates. It wasn’t 
		that we didn’t know how to use git, it was the fact that we occasionally pushed incomplete or broken pieces of code, and so 
		fixing a bug after a merge meant editing, re-writing, or completely removing pieces of code pushed by another team member, which
		sometimes caused more bugs because a lot of our code was very dependent, at least before we implemented the database layer. 
		We did write unit tests, but they were mostly a placeholder to fulfil requirements rather than tests for our implementation. 
		Also, writing code for a user story or a unit test that works temporarily with no account for edge cases, coupling, or general 
		dynamicity in mind is sometimes an enormous technical debt and it will lead to a lot of conflicts. Finally, planning how something 
		will work in iteration 3 so in iteration 1 is not some sort of sinful waste of time, it’s pretty clever actually. For example, in 
		iteration 3 we had to add new fields and tables to the database, which meant we had to edit all associated objects constructors’, 
		their getters, and the interface for each associated persistence class including off course the data stubs. This took days because 
		our app has a wide variety of users. Sadly, we didn’t include any of these problems in our retrospective for iteration 1 or 2 because 
		we were focused on getting new things to work rather than getting old things to work correctly.

		What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?
		</div>
		<div class="body">
		Ideally it would have been great to have had the time to learn git, android studio, and more about setting up a database prior to 
		starting the project. Given the chance to start over, we would have all taken more time to ensure that we were more careful when merging. 
		We could have prevented others work from being lost, and been more careful about the bugs that our code may cause. We could have saved 
		some time, allowing us to add more features for the release. In the third iteration we divided up the requirements and set intermediate 
		deadlines before the actual iteration deadline. By doing this we were able to focus more and stress less. Looking back, we should have set 
		similar deadlines in the previous iterations. Overall, we would have aimed to be more organized and efficient.
