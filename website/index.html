			Users that are studying or working at the University of Manitoba need a better and 
			more convenient way to access courses and student information. 
			</br>
			</br>
			The Better than Aurora system (BTA), as the name implies, will be a 
			better alternative to the existing Aurora system. When needing to quickly check any 
			course information like registration dates or wanting to add or remove courses, 
			or if the user needs to quickly look up student information,
			BTA can assist in this, since Aurora is designed for desktop only use. 
			It is designed mainly for students and admin, but there are functions for advisors 
			and instructors to use too. This is so that they can more easily access 
			their account information and course lists from a mobile device if they cannot 
			access a computer. BTA will add more convenience to managing courses and student 
			accounts.
