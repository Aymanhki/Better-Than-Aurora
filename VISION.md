# Better Than Aurora Registration System A01


## Summary:


The Better Than Aurora(BTA) Registration System is designed to assist students in progressing towards a designated degree by allowing them to enroll in prerequisite courses as well as keep track of completed ones. The system will also provide a detailed, editable, and up to date program plan with basic registrar’s office features.
 
 
## Goal:
The goal of creating the system  to make registration an easy process for the students. Therefore, it will be primarily designed for students. However, instructors, student advisors, and administrators are needed extensively to ensure registration within the system goes smoothly.


## Target Audience:


### Students:


The system will allow students to add and drop courses, access information about past and current courses, pay tuition, request official documents,  and see the completed credit hours towards the desired degree. The system will additonaly help students know which prerequisites are required for course registration as well as notify them if they have any holds on their account that could prevent them from adding courses. Finally, the BTA will also allow students to access a catalog for details such as the code, title description, and availability of each course. 


### Advisors:


As for advisors, the system will allow access for the recorded information about students to better assist them. In addition, advisors will be able to grant permission for courses,  review final grade appeals, and authorize overrides for special case withdrawals. 


### Admins:


Then, administrators will have the highest access to the system as they are the ones that will be maintaining and updating the entire database. In BTA administrators can create new student accounts, remove existing student accounts, change the courses available for registration, and change details of all the courses listed (name, professor, time, location, number of students that can register.). Administrators will also be able to set when a course is available for registration as well as put holds on certain students’ accounts so that they cannot register. 


## Value:


The system will provide unique value for students because it will gather resources from different platforms and save valuable research time and effort. The vision for the BTA Registration system is to combine features from Aurora and UMAchieve in one place and display them in a coherent manner for better overall student experience. The system will also include a detailed schedule for courses to help students manage time around assignments, labs, or tests. 


## Success Criteria:


In the early stages, the success of the system will be measured by a poll. If they have not used Aurora before we will ask them how they liked using BTA, or if they have used Aurora we will ask if they liked BTA better than Aurora. To meet our success criteria the poll must be at least 60% positive. The long term success will be measured by taking into account the number of calls to the registrar’s office helpdesk and the number of views on videos that help students register in courses using BTA. To meet our criteria the average must be less than 40% of the student population.


## Branching Strategy:

Our team had discussed the thought about using Git flow as our branching strategy. As we progressed with the project, we committed and pushed all our changes to specified branches with a description of what that branch contained. Once it was made sure that there were not any bugs and the feature worked as intended with the rest of the program, we then merged the branch to main. We chose this branching method so that everything would update steadily, and everyone could stay up to date with all changes.
